** TODO:
- create constructors for every Tensor data type
- make generic api for the library for working with Tensor containing given data type data array
- create algebraic operations with tensors
- accelerate library with parallel threads on cpu
- accelerate library with parallel threads on gpu
- make dynamic api for working with accelerated algebraic operations
- write documentation for library


** DONE:
- make base project structure
- improve base Tensor data structure to avoid memory fragmentation and speed up working with instances
